It seems impossible to have completed this course project without the abundant help and guidance by our course instructor Professor Mike Ferdman. We immensely thank the course mailing list acted as a great source of constant aid during the development of this project. 
Also, following are some of our peers of CSE 506 class who were very helpful in extending great help when we faced pitfalls in development - Udit Kumar Gupta, Sahil Parmar, Shashank Gupta, Sohil Gandhi, Haseeb Niaz, Gautam Goswami, Chidambaram Ramanathan, Samudra Banerjee and Prashant Pandey.
